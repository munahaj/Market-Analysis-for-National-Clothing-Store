# Market-Analysis-for-Clothing-Store
A national clothing store has requested an analysis for their new marketing campaign which targets their lost clients through advertising specific products in specific locations, but they do not know who to target. They have three products in mind:
Shirt: $25
Sweater: $100
Leather Bag: $1,000
Through our analysis, we used a variety of data sources, including US Census Bureau, Business Data, Customer Data & addiotnal data such as weather which helped us determined the best product to advertise to each customer.
