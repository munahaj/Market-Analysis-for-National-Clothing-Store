# Market-Analysis-for-Clothing-Store
An american national clothing store has approached us requesting an analysis report for their new marketing campaign which will target their lost clients through advertising specific products in specific locations, but they do not know who particularly among their clients to target. They have three products in mind that they wish to promote:

Shirt: $25

Sweater: $100

Leather Bag: $1,000

Through our analysis, we used a variety of data sources, including US Census Bureau to help us determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of their customers, but we should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history and locations, and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, we analyzed the inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two. 

We also referred to other data sources such as Business Data, Customer Data and other addiotnal data such as weather to decide the best product to advertise for each unique customer.

In order to draw definitive conclusions from our analysis, we decided to focus on answering certain analytic questions and translate the results using suitable visualizations.

**The questions are:**

* What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and income?
* What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and product return rate?
* What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer sales and customer incomes?
* Which customer do you predict has the highest income?
* Which product will be advertised the most?
